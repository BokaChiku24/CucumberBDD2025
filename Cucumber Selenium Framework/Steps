Cucumber Seleneium Framework from Scratch

1. Build Maven project with all the framework dependencies
   Develop End to End Selenium Web Scenarios in the Cucumber Framework feature file

2. Implement TestNG/Junit Runner to run the framework

3. Understand the Single responsibility principle to distribute the implementation into multiple step definitions

4. Importance of Dependency injection to share the data between the step file

5. Understand the Page Object Pattern to drive the locators from page files

6. Implement Page factory Design Pattern by writting Page Object Manager class to create objects of all PO class

7. How driver can be configured and distributed across the files in the framework

8. How to run the framework in parallel mode using Cucumber TestNG runner

9. Build test utility classes to handle the common functionality like reading data from excel,
writing data to excel, reading data from properties file, writing data to properties file, handling screenshots,
handling logs, etc.

10. Implement cuucmber hook to capture the screenshots on failure and to handle the browser close/open functionality

11. Implement cucumber tags to run the scenarios based on the tags

12. Paramerterizing the test data to run the scenarios with different data sets

13. Creating HTML and Extent reports to generate the test execution report

14. Running test in parallel mode using TestNG and generate extent report of the screeenshots failure for each scenario

15. Run the cucumber test using maven command and command line arguments

16. Integrate the framework with CI/CD tools like Jenkins to automate the test execution and schedule the test runs

17. Create parameterized Jenkins job to run the tests with different browser and environment configurations
